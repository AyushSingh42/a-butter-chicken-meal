    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A traditional flat bread from India, naan breads are normally baked inside hot Tandoor ovens with charcoal or wood fire. They cook on the inner walls of the oven at a very high heat of up to 900Â°F. The breads fill with air pockets and cook perfectly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cups plain flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine together the water, sugar and yeast. Let sit for 5-10 minutes or until the mixture begins to bubble on top</li>
        <li>Add in the milk, yogurt, oil, flour baking powder and salt. Mix until the dough comes together with your hands.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Use floured hands to knead the dough until smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the same mixing bowl with a small spray of cooking oil. Transfer dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for about an hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Roll into balls, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece of dough into a large oval, about 6-inches long and 1/8-inch thick. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the extra oil.</li>
        <li>Place one piece of the naan on the oiled hot skillet and cook until bubbles form on top, about 1-2 minutes. While cooking, brush the top with a little oil.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until large golden spots appear on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove from the skillet and wrap in a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining naan (keep them wrapped in a towel while you work).</li>  
    </ol>
